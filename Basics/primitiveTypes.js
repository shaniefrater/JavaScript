// In JS, there are two different categories of types (Primitive and Reference)
// Primitive consists of (Strings, Numbers, Boolean, Undefined & Null)

let firstName = "Shanie"; // string Literal
let age = 23; // number literal
let isBritish = true; // boolean literal (returns true or false)
let secondName; // Not defined so will return undefined
let middleName = null; // Null is used when you want to clear the name of a variable

console.log(firstName, age, isBritish);

// Primitive types are immutable (which means they cannot be changed after they've been defined)
